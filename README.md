Mixwave is a self hostable platform that aims to simplify the complexities of video delivery. Transcode and package your media for online streaming with simple API calls and sane defaults, or craft dynamic HLS playlists on the fly with bumpers, ads and filters.

- Transcode your video file into separate quality tracks (eg; 1080p, 720p, 480p).
- Write `HLS CMAF` playlists directly to S3, ready to be played by [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js).
- Scale `ffmpeg` jobs horizontally, at up to 80% cost reduction on [EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).
- Dynamically stitch HLS playlists together<sup>experimental</sup>, like a Netflix bumper, with [HLS interstitials](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/GettingStartedWithHLSInterstitials.pdf).
- Parses a `vmap`, transcodes and packages the ad media files and inserts interstitials, on the fly.
- Ships with a `HLS.js` wrapper that simplifies working with interstitials and a React UI.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035cd10e-53b4-4b0f-99cd-79c76c26e0b0

This video contains recordings from the dashboard, a simple, unified, way to interact with the API, view transcode and package jobs with their statuses, or toy around with the player devtools.

Very briefly, the video demonstrates the following:

- Transcodes and packages a BigBuckBunny mp4 source into HLS, in multiple qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p).
- Creates a playback session that uses a previously transcoded and packaged bumper mp4 source, and adds it at an interstitial at position `0`.
- Uses a Google [IMA sample](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/tags) to serve two ads, one preroll and a midroll at position `15`.

## Why?

Video is quite fragmented, particularly in the way video content is delivered and protected across different platforms and devices. Think [MPEG-DASH vs. HLS](https://www.gumlet.com/learn/hls-vs-dash/), CTR vs. CBCS, [SSAI vs. CSAI](https://clearcode.cc/blog/client-side-server-side-ad-insertion/). Besides, there's also a lot of cool things happening behind closed doors, like SGAI with [AWS EMT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/server-guided.html) or [Disney+](https://medium.com/disney-streaming/using-sgai-to-deliver-and-play-ads-with-flexibility-and-scale-b5c18aeb7bca). We aim to avoid fragmentation by picking the right tools for the job. If you don't have to do the same thing multiple times, aiming for perfection is a lot easier. We believe `HLS CMAF` is the right way forward, and when playlist manipulation is required, we tend to lean towards `HLS Interstitials`. There's obviously going to be roadblocks ahead, think of devices not supporting multiple video elements or partially serving encrypted fragments opposed to plain ads. We'll tackle these once we get there.

There's a lot of video tooling out there, think of ffmpeg, bento4, shaka-packager, but not in a unified manner. Mixwave implements the excellent work done by others, and tries to make it approachable in the form of an API with a strong focus on scalability and ease of use. The latter is quiet challenging, you'd only have to look at how complex ffmpeg gets when you tip into the details.

Video from source to consumer is a hard task to get right, [howvideo.works](https://howvideo.works/) is a great resource to get you started.
