# Package

Video packaging refers to the process of preparing a video file for delivery and consumption by users across different devices and platforms.

- The video is split into smaller segments or chunks, usually a few seconds long, to facilitate adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), which adjusts quality based on network conditions.

- A manifest file (m3u8 for HLS) is generated. It contains metadata about the available segments, bitrates, and resolutions, helping the player know what content to request based on the userâ€™s network conditions.

## API

The package job will prepare an HLS playlist for your asset. Before you package, check the [transcode](/features/transcode) instructions.

::: code-group

```sh [shell]
curl -X POST https://api.domain.com/package
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d "{body}"
```

:::

A minimal body payload may look like this:

```json
{
  "assetId": "f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689"
}
```

Your asset is now available for playback at:

```
{S3_PUBLIC_URL}/package/f7e89553-0d3b-4982-ba7b-3ce5499ac689/hls/master.m3u8
```

::: tip
Each package result is uploaded to /package/{assetId}/hls/master.m3u8
:::

## Example

We started by [transcoding](/features/transcode#example) two input files (content.mp4 and bumper.mp4) to multiple streams. We'll now package these their HLS master and media playlists files.

```
input   = 67b070fd-5db6-4022-a568-652abdbfac9c
output  = https://my.cdn/package/67b070fd-5db6-4022-a568-652abdbfac9c/hls/master.m3u8
```

```
input   = 13b1d432-ec8e-4516-9904-df1aa90db803
output  = https://my.cdn/package/13b1d432-ec8e-4516-9904-df1aa90db803/hls/master.m3u8
```
